            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">I'm not someone who joined Team Unwired out of my love for cars. To be honest, my only goal was to make myself productive and get some hands on experience. I still remember messing up with my interview, saying stupid things like my Kawasaki Caliber is a 300 cc motorcycle and The kerb weight of a Maruti 800 is 1.5 tonnes. Every time I went through the answer sheets or interviewed my juniors who appeared for induction, I used to recount these, and wonder how foolish I was. But then, I got selected into the club ( obviously, and that's why I am writing this now). This was the happiest thing that happened to me in a rather messed up second semester.
<br><br><div>&nbsp;As it is said that the best things in your life always comes with a price, my homesick mind had to choose vacation stays over chilling at home during sem breaks. But after a while, the college and the team became a foster home for me. The first year at team unwired was rather disappointing for me.  I had registered myself for Formula Student competition by mistake, and thought myself to be a part of the BAJA team. When I came to know about it and joined the FS team, it was too late for me to contribute anything to the team. All I did was procuring some stuff for the team, a day before we had to leave for the competition. I missed my train which was scheduled at noon. Bewildered, I was waiting near the Rajpath. That is when someone told me that the truck carrying our car,to Comibatore, is yet to leave. It already had two of my teammates inside. The driver was reluctant initially, as it is illegal to allow passengers in a truck. After so much of persuasion, the driver gave in and let me travel with them. That is still one of the most memorable road trips in my life. We reached there by around 4'o clock. By then, the restless procuring process and the journey had taken a toll on my health. I fell ill with a throat infection and couldn't even talk, the next day. Whenever someone phones me, I had to ask my friends to speak to them on my behalf. This has given rise to a lot of funny incidents. On the other hand, the vehicle was not in an encouraging condition, either. It could barely stand on its own wheels. After two days of stay(which translates into sleeping over anything that remotely resembles a sleeping bag) there in the pit, after understanding that I'm of no use and more of a burden in the present condition, to the team, I had to leave, not even able to watch the most coveted endurance race. Needless to say, we didn't clear the TI. This was also the period of time I was going through depression. This deplorable performance added to my worries.

I was with the power train division. Right after registering for the event, in the second year summer holidays, we had a Design Presentation at Chitkara University, Chandigarh. I was one among the five people representing the team for the event. Since the performance of my team also depends on my preparation, I had to force myself to study. This kind of reduced the time available for overthinking and eventually helped me to get out of depression. Also, it was the fundamentals that I learned in that period which helped me in my studies over the next two years. I still remember my captain, Arun Sebastian telling a rather pessimistic me, how exactly this would be beneficial in the placement process, which I understood only later, in the fourth year, when campus selection was happening. Also that journey helped me bond with my teammates, developing a rapport which we still share.  This trip is easily the best thing that happened to me in my life,so far. &nbsp;<br></p>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">The next one year what we saw, was a dream unfolding before us. We finally made a running vehicle, battling all the financial constraints. I should confess here , that I wasn't a very good team player, to begin with. But whatever little capabilities, I have right now, to work in a team, I owe them to Team  Unwired.  Our competition took place  in March. Learning from previous experiences, we were able to qualify the TI. Our vehicle was the third best in terms of acceleration. For the same reason, hopes were high for the endurance race. How I stood near the vehicle with a fire extinguisher on my hands, before the endurance race, is still on my mind. Every time our car completed a lap, we received it with cheers.This was one of the most satisfying experiences in our lives.

The chassis member was quickly fixed. It was when we were about to send the vehicle back to the tracks that we discovered the problem with the gearbox. We were disappointed, yet frantically doing everything possible to fix it. We opened it up and found that the key in one of the shafts has failed due to fatigue. This was the least expected among all parts to fail. Due to the same reason, we didn't have any spare parts with us. We did some jugad using the CVT key and sent the vehicle back. It only ran for a few more laps. But then, that day, we all learned a thing or two about managing unprecedented setbacks. After an impressive acceleration event, we had our hopes high, pinned onto the endurance race,which happens to be the a game changer in the competition. Comprehending this mishap was a learning experience. Not able to perform the way we wanted to, was painful, yet, we quickly conditioned ourself to accept it gracefully and feel satisfied over the journey we had, which helped us turn our vision into reality. <br></p>

From that first year kid who scolded me  for touching our own exhibit at Tathva, and later apologizing by 'sorry chetta' when I told him that I myself am a member of TUW( which was the only time he called me chetta, though ) to one of my most trusted confidants, our friendship was forged through a series of debates and conversations(technical and otherwise) that took place inside the work space, during these visits.</p>

Sadly, it's still an unfinished dream. Today, the juniors of Unwired have given us a formal farewell. But I still couldn't stop thinking about myself as a part of the club. And I'm sure, it will be the case for all my teammates.
</div><div>&nbsp;Looking back, I had the privilege of participating in both BAJA and FS. I could accompany both the vehicles when it was transported to the competition venue, bringing along our dreams and aspirations. These are memories that I will cherish, for my entire life. When I joined the club, little did I know that this is gonna help me shape my life, get me out of depression and form some invaluable personal relationships that I would treasure for the rest of my life. Most importantly, through those umpteen mistakes, technical blunders we have made, and then rectified, I understood why it is said that experience is just another name for mistakes made in the past.</div></div>
