            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">When I think of the team Unwired as a whole, it's more like a sequence of events rather than one single story. This story is about how a series of decisions which we made became the backbone of everything that we are today.<br><br><div></div><div>Late in the spring of 2018 our seniors called a meeting with the team, they informed us that most of the design work has been done and now we may start the manufacturing, but only issue was, we were lacking funds. So the entire team decided to pitch in the money from our own pockets, this was the very first investment towards building the beauty that brought us Pride and Glory at the competition. We knew that were just getting started, but at that point we never thought that it is the beginning of so many other struggles.&nbsp;</div><br><div>As I was in the powertrain engineering team, I was sort of disconnected from the progress of the chassis engineering team, throughout the winter vacation the chassis engineering team worked day and night to complete the chassis ahead of time so that the powertrain and suspension team could get to work. Fast forward to January 2019, we were informed that we should check the health of the engine and figure out a way to get it running reliably, initially we thought that this was going to be a simple task, but later we were told that running the engine reliably what's the milestone in our timeline and we should get it done as soon as possible. We wasted no time and me along with the rest of the powertrain team got to work, initially we thought of using the existing high performance stand alone ECU, but after several tries and an internal examination we found out that the ECU was completely shot. So the only option left for us was to get a new ECU, while searching for a good ECU we found out that even the cheapest one cost over 50,000. This was out of option for us at the moment as we were already struggling with funds, so we were left without a choice. But on one event full day we decided to clean our workspace, and guess what, in the process we found our old Duke 390 stock ECU. Finding the ECU was only half of the problem because we were pretty sure that the ECU was lying there collecting dust and grease for at least 2 years, so we hoped for the best and decided to give our new discovery a try. With this decision came our second biggest problem, that is figuring out the wiring.</div></div>

<br>With me and the other members of the powertrain team being from the electrical and electronics department we also had the weight of expectations on our shoulders, since we were supposed to be the ones who were natural at solving circuits. There again the gap between what we learn in classrooms and what works in the real world came back to haunt us. Armed with Kirchhoff law and Microcontroller basics, we set out to decipher the cryptic wiring once and for all. But as we expected, nothing was going in our favor.&nbsp;<br></p>

After one month of online research, trial and error and a lot of mistakes we figured out most of the things. We found out the colour codes, how to bypass sensors and how to troubleshoot basic things, but there was only one thing remaining, that is to fire the engine. Firing the engine was the last remaining step, we spent a good amount of time searching for ways to get the engine running, after countless hours of digging through the forums and repair manual we were still disappointed, as we could not find a proper solution or someone who could help us.

Our new found friend looked at  the wiring for a minute, and he made one additional connection in the wiring that we never made, let alone the thought of making that connection didn't even cross our mind. That connection which he made was that of the kill switch, which is the basic thing you have to do to get any engine to start. But as always in any formula student project, we tend to look at the bigger picture and lose the smaller details in the process, this is perhaps the most important thing which I learned while working with the team.&nbsp;<br></p>

The feelings which were going through our minds at the time were unexplainable, we were happy, tired and excited all at the same time. This happened at a point where we all had lost hope, but I guess the world had other plans for us. We were tested to our limits, and there were times when we nearly gave up.

But we learned from our mistakes soon and started the engine, so that the entire team could see that we had hit the milestone and crushed it. 
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">At this point we were feeling a sense of accomplishment that one would get after climbing a mountain or solving a differential equation. &nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span><div>Now we could start the engine at our will, and we could get it to behave according to our wishes, we became the master of our car's power plant.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">After this we got adventurous and tried hacking the wiring for adding our modifications. We started off the hacking trend with a remote starting and stopping device, with this setup we could switch on and off our engine using our smartphones. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Those where the times where we felt as if we were real engineers who were making a difference, and improving things that others thought is perfect.&nbsp;</span></div><div>However this hack didn't make it into the final car, as this could potentially be another point of failure and we wanted our car to be the most reliable. 
</div><br><div>But in the end we were satisfied with what we had achieved, and was able to witness our creation run perfectly for half a lap at the final endurance race ( after half a lap the a bearing broke inside the engine, out of all the things we expect to fail , this was at the bottom, yet it happened ), despite all this , the engine kept going and completed 4 laps. ( this is the human equivalent of running a full marathon uphill with a broken leg ). Nevertheless we were among the top 30 teams that made it to the endurance race from the 118 teams at the competition. And we were the only new team to make it to the endurance race, as the rest of the teams were seasoned contestants. We had learned our lessons, and we were now confident in our abilities and the team's unity as we had pulled off such a feat , picking ourselves up from the bottom everytime we fell. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
