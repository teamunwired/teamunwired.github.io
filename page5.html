            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">Team Unwired has always been an integral part of my college life. Ever since I was inducted into the FS team at the end of my first year, unwired has touched my life in countless ways. It has had a very large role in making me who I am today. 
<div>Being a junior in unwired meant countless hours perfecting various fabrication techniques, mostly grinding and cutting with a few instances of lathe thrown in. It meant goodbye to going home for vacations and all nighters in the workspace. I spent my time trying to learn the ropes of what it meant to be in the suspension team. The first season went by quickly with a rather disappointing result in FS 2018. 
</div><div>This however did not dampen the excitement of getting to design a formula student car all by ourselves the next season. Our team faced a lot of pressure, mostly from ourselves, to design and fabricate a reliable car. Our goal was not to build the fastest car or the most innovative car, it was to build the most reliable car. 
</div><div>Things really took a turn for the better when we sorted out the wiring system and got the engine to start. It provided a much-needed boost for everyone’s morale. Work on the car really picked up from that point onwards. The three-month long vacation before the competition was among the best time I had got to spend in college. We were able to work on the car to our hearts content without the stress of having to complete academic work. It was just us and the car.

They really stepped up and took on responsibility. That was probably what pushed us seniors to drop everything else and give it our all. The unwavering dedication shown by each and every member was something which I had never experienced before.&nbsp;<br><br>The day the car stood on its own four wheels is still fresh in my mind. It meant that my suspension design wasn’t a total failure. Even though I did all the calculations and simulations, to see it actually working in front of my eyes was an exhilarating sight. I literally jumped with joy. The juniors probably had no idea why I was so happy, I hope they get to experience the same sensation when they get to see their brainchild come to life in front of them. &nbsp;<br></p>

This was unfamiliar territory for us. We had gone through the rulebook countless times to ensure our car was in compliance, but even then, some mistakes crept in. It took us three days and hours of work and effort to finally pass. By then most of our team, including me had fallen victim to violently upset stomachs. This sapped our energy and had bedridden a few of our members. This unforeseen event didn’t dampen our passion. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and everyone knew it. Everyone put in that extra effort and pushed on, fuelled by passion. &nbsp;<br>We made it into the final 30 qualified for the endurance race. Our excitement knew no bounds. Especially me and Aswanth as we were the designated drivers. To drive in the same circuit which once hosted a formula one event in a self-made car was something very few will get to experience.<br></p>
