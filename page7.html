            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-5">Joining Team Unwired is ofcourse a life changing decision for everyone. For me it all started from the common room of A hostel. When all the clubs were introduced by their respective seniors, as an automobile enthusiast, I knew it was Team Unwired that i am going to fit in, all I thought then was that the club is just to satisfy my automotive cravings. But it didn't take much time to prove myself I was wrong.
<div></div><div>
</div><div>The inductions were done and I was selected as a junior to the brake subteam.
</div><div>But that didn't stop me from "interfering" with the works of other sub teams, because I wanted to learn as much as I could from the team and also to contribute my best in all ways to the team. Since most of the designing works were already done by our seniors, we had a lot of fabrication work to focus on, from which I gained on hand experience on most of the machining tools and operations and got familiarized with most of the components of the vehicle.

<br>The day we did the brake test for the first time on Rajpath, and all the wheels locked together, is still one of the most satisfying moments I ever witnessed. When most of the audience were cheering for the speed and acceleration of the vehicle, I personally was happy when the car came to a standstill from about 40kmph in just 4 meters. That was the first successful brake test in my Unwired life.
<br>The 2 months vacation flew like anything with perfectly scheduled work and frequent trips to Kozhikode and Coimbatore. The vehicle was completed in the time being with overloaded days and sleepless night outs.&nbsp;<br></p>

I was worried at first on how to spend these days in a single compartment of the train, but it went by in the blink of an eye. The journey through the western ghats is really a breathtaking one. And Rajasthan didn't seem so hot as it is said in the books. Overall, the journey was perfect in all aspects and was much more enjoyable than I initially thought.
<br>The team reached Delhi a day before competition and rushed to the hotels to take rest and get ready for the next day.
<br>We woke up early, eager to see the car after a week's wait. We went to the track and unloaded the trailer and pushed the vehicle to the pit.
<br>All three days of technical inspection was really tight for us because we had some issues to be rectified with the vehicle, which put all of the team members in a lot of pressure.<br></p>
